Performance test types	Objective
Normal load (Load test)	To assess system performance under normal load condition
Peak load (Lead test)	To assess system performance under peak load condition
N x peak load (Stress test)	To assess system performance under N x peak load condition
Breakpoint test	To determine maximum capacity of the system
To understand system behavior when loading exceed max capacity
Spike test	To determine whether system can withstand occasional spikes in load
Duration test (Soak test)	To assess system performance under normal load condition for a long period of time


Some of the main objectives of performance testing include the following: 
1.	To identify: 
a)	Application's response time
b)	Application's throughput
c)	Maximum number of concurrent users supported by the application
d)	Application behavior under different load conditions
e)	Applicationâ€™s breakpoint
f)	Resources (e.g. CPU, memory, disk I/O) utilization of the system
2.	To verify application/system stability under stress or long period of operation
3.	To ensure application performance meets SLA
4.	To demonstrate the system has sufficient capacity to support projected business growth



Gather requirements & Define test scope

Plan performance test & Design test scenarios(test environment, data, tool requirements)

Prepare test script

Execute test

Analyze result
